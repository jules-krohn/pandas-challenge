Module 4 Challenge 
Code for counting the number of unique schools: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-count-distinct-values-of-a-pandas-dataframe-column/

Most code came from class, with help from Thom Banninga, Willie Hobbs, Alex Stewart, and Azi Farooquee in a study group session on the highest/bottom performing schools section, as well as the scores by school spending section. 

Tutor Kyle Good gave assistance with syntax and logic throughout the project.
