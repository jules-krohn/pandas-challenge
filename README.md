Module 4 Challenge
The PyDistrictSchools challenge is an analysis of a school district's student test scores against a variety of factors including, size, student grade level, school spending, and school type (charter or public). This analysis plans to show school and student performance trends across the school district. 


Code for counting the number of unique schools: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-count-distinct-values-of-a-pandas-dataframe-column/

Most code came from class, with help from Thom Banninga, Willie Hobbs, Alex Stewart, and Azi Farooquee in a study group session on the highest/bottom performing schools section, as well as the scores by school spending section. 

Tutor Kyle Good assisted with syntax and logic throughout the project.
